		<h1>Paragraph and Paragraph Elements</h1>
		<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored. The following demonstrates this.</p>
		
		<p>My Bonny lies over the ocean.
		
			My Bunny lies over the sea.
			
				My Bunny lies over the ocean.
				
				Oh, bring back my Bunny to me!
		</p>
		
		<p>My Bonny lies over the ocean.</p>
		<p>Oh, bring back my Bunny to me!</p>
		<hr/>
		
		<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks. This is demonstrated as follows:</p>
		
		<pre>My Bonny lies over the ocean.
		
			My Bunny lies over the sea.
			
				My Bunny lies over the ocean.
				
				Oh, bring back my Bunny to me!
		</pre>
		<hr/>
		<p>This is <br/> a paragraph <br/> with line breaks</p>
